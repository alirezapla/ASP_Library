## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    ASP.NET Core: For building the API.

    Entity Framework Core: For database operations and ORM.

    SQL Server: As the relational database.

    AutoMapper: For mapping between entities and DTOs.

    Swagger: For API documentation and testing.

    Dependency Injection: For managing dependencies and services.

    Middleware: For global exception handling and request validation.

## Getting Started

**Restore NuGet packages:**

    dotnet restore

**Update the database connection string:**

Open the `appsettings.json` file.

Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section.

Modify the `DefaultConnection` value to point to your SQL Server (or other database) instance.  Ensure the database server is running and accessible.


    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=LibraryDB;User Id=your_user_id;Password=your_password;"
    }

**Apply database migrations:**


    dotnet ef database update

manual script for migration:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IX_Books_Author_Title_Publisher
    ON Books (AuthorId,Title,PublisherId)
    WHERE IsDeleted = 0;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IX_PublisherName
    ON Publishers (PublisherName)
    WHERE IsDeleted = 0;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IX_CategoryName
    ON Categories (Name)
    WHERE IsDeleted = 0;
```
**Build the project:**


    dotnet build

**Run the application:**

    
    dotnet run

**Access the application:**

        The API will be available at https://localhost:5001 (or http://localhost:5000).

        Use Swagger UI to explore and test the API endpoints: https://localhost:5001/swagger.

## Configuration

**appsettings.json:**  The primary configuration file for the application.  You can configure database connection strings, logging settings, and other application-specific parameters in this file.
